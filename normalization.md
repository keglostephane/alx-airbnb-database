# Database Normalization

## First Normal Form (1NF)
 
* tables have a primary key that identifies each row uniquely.
* tables' columns contain atomic values.
 

## Second Normal Form (2NF)

* tables satisfy 1NF.
* All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key.


## Third Normal Form (3NF)

* tables satisfy 2NF.
* All non-key attributes fully depend on the primary key. There is no transitive dependencies.
